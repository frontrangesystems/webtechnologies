# FrsWebTechnologies

## Using With .Net

This project is only the Angular 2 front end. to build execute `ng build --watch`. This will place it in the 'app/angular' folder of the FrontRangeSystems.WebTechnologies.Web project. Another approach found here (http://rostacik.net/2015/08/14/how-to-disable-building-of-typescript-files-in-visual-studio-2015/) is to add `<TypeScriptCompileBlocked>true</TypeScriptCompileBlocked>` to the first `<PropertyGroup>` in the project file.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
